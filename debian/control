Description: Buy and manage SSL certificates from the command line
 sslmate is the command line client for SSLMate <https://sslmate.com>, a
 service for purchasing and managing SSL certificates.  SSLMate provides
 easy-to-use tools for buying, renewing, and revoking certificates, for
 monitoring the expiration date of your certificates, and for synchronizing
 your certificates between your servers.
 .
 SSLMate emphasizes speed, ease-of-use, and automation.  For example, the
 command to purchase a certificate (sslmate buy) typically completes in
 under a minute and automates the steps of generating a private key,
 generating a CSR, and building a certificate bundle.  SSLMate can
 automatically renew your certificates, and you can run sslmate download
 from a cron job so that renewed certificates are automatically downloaded
 to your server.
 .
 To use the sslmate command, you must create a free account at
