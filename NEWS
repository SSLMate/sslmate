    certificate.
  * Add `sslmate mkconfig` command for generating server configuration
    for a certificate.
  * Add --temp option to `sslmate buy` and `sslmate download`.  If
    specified, a temporary, self-signed, certificate will be installed
    instead of waiting for the real cert to be issued.  This temporary
    cert won't be trusted by clients, but can be used for configuring
    your server while you wait for your real cert to be issued.
  * Add --invoice-note and --email-invoice-to options to `sslmate buy`
    for customizing invoices.
  * Output non-error informational messages to stdout instead of stderr.

    - The --email=ADDRESS option specifies the desired approver address.
    - The --no-wait option tells sslmate to return immediately
      instead of waiting for the new certificate to be issued.
  * Better support for key rollover in `sslmate reissue`:
    - The new key file is initially written to CN.key.new and the
      existing key file is only overwritten (by either `sslmate reissue`
      or `sslmate download`) once the new certificate is ready.
    - Existing .key and .crt files are overwritten even without the
      --force option, but only once the reissue completes successfully.
  * renew now overwrites existing .crt files even without the --force
    option. A safety check has been added to ensure that renew only
    installs a certificate if it matches the .key file.
  * API credentials are now saved to disk only if `sslmate link` is run
    explicitly. Other commands no longer implicitly link the system.
  * Minor bug fixes and internal improvements.

v0.3.0 (2014-09-12)

    --auto-renew and --no-auto-renew options to `sslmate buy`.
    See https://sslmate.com/blog/post/automating_renewals
  * Make years argument optional in `sslmate buy`; default to 1 year.
  * Add key_directory and cert_directory config options to set the
    location of purchased/downloaded files.  Defaults to $PWD for
